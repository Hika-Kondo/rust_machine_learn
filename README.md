# Rust machine learning crate
A crate for statistical machine learning implemented in rust.
This file is a translation of README-ja.md by deepl.

# Features
The implementation is based on `rust_ndarray`.
It is based on `rust_ndarray`.

# Futer Work
This is a model that we plan to implement in the future.

- [ ] linear regression
